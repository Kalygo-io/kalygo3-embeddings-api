00:00:00.280 okay here we go exclusive access this
00:00:03.919 tool allows us to build a team of
00:00:07.160 virtual assistants when I say virtual
00:00:09.760 assistant I mean agent when I say team I
00:00:13.000 mean swarm so team member is to team as
00:00:17.760 agent is to swarm hopefully that makes
00:00:20.519 sense the way we add agents to our swarm
00:00:24.199 is we can actually do this in two ways
00:00:26.039 but the first way I'll show is by
00:00:30.119 clicking this add agent button this
00:00:32.040 gives you a field where you can
00:00:34.840 customize the team member or agent each
00:00:37.800 team member is going to get a name and
00:00:40.960 here is where you can specify the team
00:00:42.600 member's Persona so we will say you are
00:00:47.000 great at
00:00:49.440 producing content for
00:00:53.800 LinkedIn before I click this button to
00:00:56.199 update the Swarm you also have to Define
00:00:58.719 our flow so the flow defines how the
00:01:02.079 messages we send to the Swarm are going
00:01:04.760 to flow through the Swarm we only have
00:01:07.119 one team member in our swarm at the
00:01:09.080 moment so we have
00:01:12.439 to
00:01:14.439 specify the team member like so this
00:01:17.759 means that when we send a message to our
00:01:19.880 swarm this team member will receive our
00:01:22.560 message generate its output and return
00:01:24.840 the output to us now I can update this
00:01:28.680 swarm right
00:01:31.079 and if I say
00:01:34.479 hello you can see our agent is
00:01:39.040 responding accordingly let's now add
00:01:41.799 another team member or agent to our
00:01:43.960 swarm team member
00:01:47.960 two and this team member will be great
00:01:51.960 for
00:01:53.479 marketing content on let's say x AKA
00:01:59.520 twit
00:02:04.000 here we'll
00:02:07.160 add uh comma then
00:02:12.440 specify the second team
00:02:15.720 member what this means is that when we
00:02:18.840 send a message to our swarm the message
00:02:20.920 we send will be received by the first
00:02:22.680 team member and by the second T member
00:02:26.200 in parallel if we were to specify an
00:02:29.959 Arrow here what this means is the
00:02:33.319 message we send to the Swarm would be
00:02:35.640 received by the first team member the
00:02:37.560 first team member would generate its
00:02:39.000 output and the output of the first team
00:02:41.080 member would be passed to the second
00:02:42.879 team member the second team member would
00:02:44.720 generate its output and would return it
00:02:46.599 back to us most of the time you're going
00:02:48.959 to keep this very simple but sometimes
00:02:51.519 you can do cool things by tweaking how
00:02:55.239 the message flows through the Swarm
00:02:57.680 we'll keep it simple for now edit the
00:02:59.599 Swarm form and let's say hello
00:03:04.280 again and you can see each team
00:03:08.120 member responds in parallel so defining
00:03:11.680 our swarm manually like we've been doing
00:03:15.000 is great but we actually have another
00:03:16.840 option as I hinted at the beginning we
00:03:19.319 can use this swarm Builder to generate a
00:03:23.400 team for us given a prompt let's specify
00:03:27.640 this prompt create a team of expert
00:03:30.840 digital marketers specialize in
00:03:32.159 producing content for the following
00:03:33.360 platforms x Facebook Instagram and
00:03:35.280 Linkedin the content each marketer
00:03:37.799 generates should be hyper optimized for
00:03:39.439 connecting deeply with the intended
00:03:41.080 audience let's run the Swarm Builder and
00:03:43.959 see what
00:03:48.879 happens so you can see our agents have
00:03:52.400 been created for
00:03:54.640 us and the Swarm Builder also suggested
00:03:59.079 how the messages we send to the Swarm
00:04:00.840 should flow through the Swarm and it
00:04:02.840 kept it very
00:04:04.519 simple no surprises there so now if we
00:04:08.519 update the
00:04:09.760 Swarm and send a message to our swarm
00:04:12.799 for example let's send this message
00:04:16.759 Market a new web application called
00:04:18.320 swarms playground available at demo.
00:04:20.600 swarms
00:04:23.800 world you can see the Twitter marketer
00:04:27.040 gives us some content for Twitter the
00:04:28.680 Facebook marketer gives gives us some
00:04:30.199 content for
00:04:31.479 Facebook the Instagram marketer gives us
00:04:33.720 some content for
00:04:35.160 Instagram and the LinkedIn marketer
00:04:37.800 gives us some content for
00:04:40.120 LinkedIn so this is amazing this you
00:04:44.120 know just a couple months or years ago
00:04:46.680 would have taken hours if not days that
00:04:49.440 gives you a good overview of how this
00:04:51.120 tool works let me show you this other
00:04:53.160 tool which is also very useful for
00:04:56.199 Content generation so here I have
00:04:59.720 pre-loaded a swarm that is specialized
00:05:03.639 for marketing on various social media
00:05:06.520 platforms and what this swarm does is
00:05:10.720 output the generated content for each
00:05:14.800 member of the Swarm into a
00:05:18.120 spreadsheet so if I send this message
00:05:21.720 again Market a new web application
00:05:23.360 called swarms playground available at
00:05:24.759 demo. sw. world we can see each of the
00:05:28.000 marketers generating it
00:05:30.800 output and when all the marketers have
00:05:34.400 finished generating their content we'll
00:05:37.199 be presented with a spreadsheet that we
00:05:39.600 can
00:05:42.319 download we can download the spreadsheet
00:05:45.479 and import this
00:05:47.199 into any tool that is capable of reading
00:05:52.319 spreadsheets and this is fantastic cuz
00:05:54.560 we can pass this on to other team
00:05:56.919 members who can edit this and make sure
00:05:59.000 it gels well well with the overall brand
00:06:01.919 of the company that we're doing this
00:06:03.720 work for
